          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p align="justify">
          It is an infection of part of urinary system which can be either kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Commonly urinary tract infection (UTI) occurs in the lower urinary tract involving bladder and the urethra.
          <br><br>
Women are more affected by urinary tract infection than men. It becomes a painful condition and patient gets distress while passing urine.
<br><br>
The urinary system starts externally from urethra- the tubular passage through which urine is excreted out. Urethra is then attached to bladder- a sac like structure which collects urine from both ureters connected to respective kidneys. Ureters are tubular structures that carry away urine formed in kidneys to bladder.
<br><br>
Thus urinary infection can pass on easily to other parts of urinary system. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent further progress of infection and complications.

          <h2>Causes & Risk Factors</h2>
          <p align="justify">
          Urethra is frequently exposed to infectious organisms due to its anatomy. Either through bowel (intestinal microbes) from anus to urethra or sexual contact these organisms enter in urethra. Mere presence of infectious organisms doesn’t cause urinary tract infection. They multiply in favorable conditions to cause infection.
          <br><br>
Escherichia coli (E. coli), is chief bacteria that causes UTI. Apart from it staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella, proteus, pseudomonas bacteria lead to UTI. Rarely virus or fungi can cause urinary tract infections.
<br><br>
There are many risk factors that favor the infection as follows:<br>
<b>- Gender:</b> Women are more affected because the length of their urethra is shorter as compared to men. Thus germs can travel fast upwards and reach up to bladder and further.<br>
<b>- Stasis of urine:</b> When urine is not voided frequently and remains in urinary passage for long time then the infectious organisms can multiply and lead to infection. This can happen in case of kidney stones, prostate enlargement, pregnancy, urinary tract abnormalities etc.<br>
<b>- Sexual transmitted disease:</b> Those who are affected with sexually transmitted disease are more prone to get affected by urinary tract infection. Especially in case of women, as vagina is closer to urethral opening infectious organisms that cause herpes, gonorrhea and Chlamydia enter into urethra. These organisms are capable of causing urinary tract infections.<br>
<b>- Diabetes mellitus:</b> Increased amount of sugar in urine forms favorable medium for organisms to grow and multiply.<br>
<b>- Sexual transmitted disease:</b> Those who are affected with sexually transmitted disease are more prone to get affected by urinary tract infection. Especially in case of women, as vagina is closer to urethral opening infectious organisms that cause herpes, gonorrhea and Chlamydia enter into urethra. These organisms are capable of causing urinary tract infections.<br>
<b>- Sexual activity:</b> Those who are sexually active are more prone to get affected than sexually inactive people.<br>
<b>- Certain types of contraceptive measures:</b> women who use diaphragm as contraceptive measure are at higher risk for UTI.<br>
<b>- Post menopausal women:</b> Due to lack of estrogen, changes occur in urinary tract that poses higher risk of UTI in these women.<br>
<b>- Immune suppressed conditions:</b> those people whose immune power is suppressed due to various disease conditions or medications are at risk of UTI.<br>
<b>- Catheterization: </b>Those patients who are hospitalized, or have difficulty in passing urine are catheterized for urine voiding.  This catheterization can become source of infection in UTI.

              <h2>Treatment</h2>
              <p align="justify">
                  It consists of medications as well as hygiene.<br><br>
- Acute infection is treated with antibiotics like Amoxicillin, Nitrofurantoin, Ampicillin, Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, etc.  They should be taken as per physician’s advice and entire course should be completed to prevent recurrence.<br>
- Recurrent infections require longer course of antibiotics.<br>
- Specific medications can be taken for UTI after sexual activity.<br>
- Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen supplements in case of menopausal women can reduce episodes of UTI.<br><br>
Drinking plenty of liquids esp. water to flush urinary tract.
