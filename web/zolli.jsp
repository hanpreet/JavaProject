          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p align="justify">
          Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a condition in which there is increased production of the hormone gastrin by the tumor cells which leads to increased gastric acid resulting into severe peptic ulceration. The tumors which produce the hormone gastrin are called gastrinomas, which may occur as single tumors or as multiples.
          <br><br>
The primary tumor is usually located in the duodenum (Upper part of small intestine), the pancreas, or the abdominal lymph nodes, but can also be sometimes found in abnormal locations such as  heart, ovary, gall bladder, liver and kidney.
<br><br>
The mean age of onset of ZES is 43 years and there is slight male predominance. 
<br><br>
<b>Synonyms:</b><br><br>
Z-E syndrome<br>

          <h2>Causes & Risk Factors</h2>
          <p align="justify">
         ZES may occur sporadically or as part of an autosomal dominant familial syndrome called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1). MEN I patients often have tumors of the pituitary gland (brain) and parathyroid gland (neck), as well as tumors of the pancreas.
         <br><br>
Gastrin produced by the tumor cells stimulates acid secretion, resulting in increased basal acid secretion. The large quantity of acid produced leads to gastrointestinal mucosal ulceration. It also leads to diarrhea and malabsorption. 
<br><br>
About one-half to two-thirds of single gastrinomas are cancerous (malignant) tumors that often spread to the liver and nearby lymph nodes.

          <p align="justify">
             
              - Abdominal perforation secondary to ulceration of the small intestine<br>
- Esophageal stricture, with reflux<br>
- Obstruction<br>
- Gastrointestinal bleeding<br>

              <h2>Treatment</h2>
              <p align="justify">
              The goal of the treatment is to reduce the increased acid production and resect the tumor.
<br><br>
<b>Medical Treatment</b>
<br><br>
 Proton Pump Inhibitor (Omeprazole, Rabeprazole) are the drug of choice for ZES. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists (such as famotidine and ranitidine) can also be used.  Octreotide can be used to alleviate symptoms.
<br><br>
<b>Surgical Treatment</b>
<br><br>
 Surgery to remove a single gastrinoma may be done if there is no evidence that it has spread to other organs (such as lymph nodes or the liver).
<br><br>
Other surgical methods include an embolization, which involves cutting off the tumor's blood supply; radio frequency ablation, which uses heat to eliminate the cancer cells; drugs which can be injected into the tumor to reduce symptoms or to severe the nerves which stimulate acid production, or to close up the perforations on the stomach walls or duodenum that have been caused by ulcers.
<br><br>
For patients with metastatic disease; chemotherapy, interferon, and octreotide may be used.
