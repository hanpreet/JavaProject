                                                <p>In a perfect world, each individual would have access  to the best possible physician for a particular ailment irrespective of  physical boundaries. Medical science is rapidly advancing in terms of new  techniques and super specialization. Your local doctor may not be&nbsp;&nbsp; the world authority on an ailment that you  have or the presentation thereof. Therefore, it only makes sense that you should  be able to consult a highly trained specialist who treats ailments such as  yours more often than others. <br />
However, that may not always be possible considering  the vagaries of distances, international travel barriers, costs, time zones,  paper work etc. A Global eHospital like E-Health Care transcends  these barriers and enables you to consult the best possible specialist at your  convenience, from the comfort of your home and at a nominal cost. The health  professionals that form the core team of E-Health Care have been  part of the best health-care systems for decades. They are in tune with the  changing dynamics of medical practice worldwide and the modern-day consumer&rsquo;s expectations  from &nbsp;health care. They also understand what  a &lsquo;brick and &nbsp;mortar&rsquo; hospital can  sometimes miss. You research for days on end before buying a television,  shouldn&rsquo;t you be doing the same &nbsp;before  getting yourself treated?</p>

                                                <p>There are certain unavoidable issues involved with  the way healthcare is administered in hospitals in today&rsquo;s world. Let&rsquo;s discuss  some hypothetical examples and highlight potential problems that a consumer may  face in hospitals:</p>
                                                <ol>
                                                  <li>Medicine  has become so super-specialized that sometimes it is difficult even for your doctor  to decide which of his colleagues would best treat a particular ailment. A hospital&rsquo;s  panel of consultants (the board listing all doctors at the hospital, right at  the entrance of the hospital) typically has thirty or more specialties. In such  a scenario, it becomes difficult to zero-in on the right specialist. &nbsp;For instance, a common headache may be caused  by diverse factors like high blood pressure, eye disorders, sinusitis or &nbsp;colds. It will save you tremendous time and  resources if you knew which amongst the many specialists listed would treat  your headache the best.</li>
                                                  <li>&nbsp;Also, in a hospital/ clinic, it may be  difficult to verify the antecedents and training of the specialist whom you  have visited or have been referred to. Due to tremendous overlap between  specialties as well as between different systems of medicines such as  Ayurveda/homeopathy, it is recommended that you know your doctor fully before  you visit him/her. For instance, if your doctor diagnoses sinusitis and recommends  sinus surgery as a treatment for your headache, would you be convinced enough  to go for the surgery or would you rather take a second opinion? Wouldn&rsquo;t you  want to gather enough facts and information before you make such an important  decision? Sometimes the communication may not be satisfactory and other options  may not have been explained adequately. Before proceeding with any surgery or  therapy, it may be wise to explore newer therapies and techniques by consulting  a renowned specialist. </li>
                                                </ol>
                                                <p>E-Health Care  attempts to solve some of these issues by:</p>
                                                <ol>
                                                  <li>Providing  you a panel of doctors chosen carefully from amongst the best world over.</li>
                                                  <li>Providing  information that allows you to choose the appropriate specialist for YOUR  problem. The information displayed about all doctors on E-Health Care  is verified and presented in a standard format reducing unnecessary clutter and  confusion.</li>
                                                  <li>Providing  physician support to assist you in making a crucial decision if you are still  in doubt. Even after making a choice, there will be checks in place to help you  make corrections in case you have made an error in choosing the specialist or specialty.</li>
                                                  <li>Teaching  you how to decipher whether your doctor is equipped to deal with YOUR particular  ailment and helping you make a well-informed and appropriate decision. </li>
                                                  <li>Staying  away from the &lsquo;conflict of interest&rsquo; angle providing you with honest, objective  and unbiased opinions.</li>

                                                <p>An eHospital like E-Health Care does have  its set of limitations. <br />
E-Health Care, currently, is only meant  to<strong> </strong>complement and NOT replace the physical  interaction between physicians and the patients. In case of some ailments, a  well organized internet-based consultation and virtual examination with  appropriate reports, scans and photographs can replace a physical examination  while in others, &nbsp;it may only serve as a  supportive consult to a physical examination. However, a number of innovative  solutions like digital stethoscopes, virtual glass interfaces, Virtual Blood  Pressure apparatuses and Virtual Electro-Cardiograms (ECG's) are being planned  by E-Health Care, all of which promise to transform the way we look  at healthcare forever!<br />
Added to this is the fact that a Virtual Hospital is  hamstrung by not having its own infrastructure on the ground. For example, if  you get a Computed Tomography (CT) Scan done somewhere and scan across the  plates, the Radiologists and Surgeons at &nbsp;E-Health Care may face limitations  owing to &nbsp;the quality of the films provided,  the quality of the scanning machine as well as the quality and the size of the  scanned photographs.</p>
                                                However, we do believe that a Global eHospital  has distinct advantages in providing information and options to consumers.&nbsp; The advantages will keep on increasing rapidly  as technology evolves.

                                                <p><strong>Credible Care</strong><br />
                                                  E-Health Care gives you access to  the best care-givers for your specific ailment. The unique and user-friendly &nbsp;system allows you to quickly sift through the  panel and find the most specialized and experienced doctor for your health  problems.<br />
  <strong>Affordable</strong><br />
                                                  A typical E-Health Care query can cost as little as USD $10. &nbsp;<br />
  <strong>Ethical</strong><br />
                                                  Your E-Health Care physicians will not  be driven by monetary interests when they advise you for or against surgery as  they will not be performing your surgery themselves. They are also carefully  chosen to ensure that they do not have any personal affiliations with pharmaceutical  and medical device companies.<br />
  <strong>Evidence-based Care</strong><br />
                                                  Your E-Health Care physician will  provide you care based on the current strength of peer-reviewed evidence in  medical literature.<br />
  <strong>Convenient</strong> <br />
                                                  You can seek an opinion from the best doctors globally, from the comfort of  your home, at a click. <br />
  <strong>Confidential</strong><br />
                                                  We follow all SSL / encryption protocols for data privacy on the net  through Verisign and eTrust as well as all HIPAA &nbsp;guidelines for patient data protection and  privacy.We will only share your  information with healthcare professionals selected and authorized by you.  The website is securely encrypted and modules regulate who can access your data.  We would like to add that Health  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 (P.L.104-191)  enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1996&nbsp; is one of the toughest acts to satisfy world  over for a business of this kind<br />
  <strong>Efficient</strong><br />
                                                  Now, you do not have to travel long miles, struggle for an appointment or wait  for hours at the doctor&rsquo;s office.<br />
  <strong>Safe</strong><br />
                                                  Our medical specialists are credentialed, individually trained and personally  interviewed by our Director, Medical Operations and routinely monitored to  evaluate the quality of their care. E-Health Care has a Quality  Assurance &amp; Ethics Maintenance Committee consisting of a neutral panel of  seven highly-placed individuals, from different walks of life and &nbsp;different nationalities. This Committee is led  by one of the top-most physicians of the world, who is not a part of the Physician  Panel, to ensure neutrality. This Committee audits a set number of consults  every month to ensure that you get the best possible care.<br />
  <strong>Secure</strong><br />
                                                  Our site, communications, and our patients data are all safely secured, 128 SSL  encrypted and backed up in compliance with international laws and regulations.<br />
                                                  So, even if you could have written to the same physician via email or  through a query on his website, it is just NOT the same as interacting via E-Health Care in terms of &nbsp;getting a  personalized medical opinion, signed out officially by your specialist after  consultation at the Global eHospital. Many physicians actually find it easier  to communicate systematically via E-Health Care instead of answering  queries in a haphazard manner from their own website. For this reason, many  have chosen to place a E-Health Care logo on their website that  directs traffic to their E-Health Care profile page.</p>

                                                <p>There are detailed forms for the history and &nbsp;examination details that you, the consumer/  patient will have to fill up. We do recommend taking time to do this so that  the specialist has all details needed to make a diagnosis. You can also upload  all &nbsp;past consult details, past  investigation reports, photographs of CT scans etc up to a maximum of 15 MB of  attachments. In case this space is &nbsp;not  adequate for your files, you have the facility to buy more space.Thus, in most  cases, the E-Health Care consultant will have access to all details  needed to make a diagnosis and provide more information. What makes this  process unique is that our round-the-clock website and technology platform  administrator is a physician as well! At the backend, this physician will  ensure that your specialist has everything needed to make a decision and will  contact you in case the information is inadequate, incomplete or the treating  specialist requests more information from you. &nbsp;</p>

NO documents can be uploaded through this  facility. E-Health Care recommends that you use this facility only  to ask basic medical queries and to get a generic idea about your condition or  treatment options. eQuery cannot be used to seek complete treatment as  specialists would be unable to suggest any without looking at investigations  and detailed reports. To upload these, you will need to use &nbsp;the eConsult facility.
