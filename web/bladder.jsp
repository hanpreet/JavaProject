          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
              Bladder cancer is a condition where the cells multiply and grow without normal control. The cells multiply forming growths which are referred to as tumors. The increase in the number of cells also increases the size of the tumor. Cancerous tumors are malignant and invade the space and nutrition which is meant for the tissues. These bladder cancers may travel through the lymph system and can cause cancers in remote organs.
              <br><br>
The most common type of bladder cancer is the urothelial cell carcinoma, these urothelial cells are found in the lining of the wall of the bladder and when they start proliferating abnormally they cause the urothelial cell carcinoma. 
<br><br>
The Squamous cell carcinoma is another type of a bladder cancer and here the abnormally proliferating cells are the squamous cells. This type of cancer normally occurs due to bladder inflammation that has taken place for many months or years. The Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells which make up the glands.
<br><br>
Cancer is a condition where there is an abnormal multiplication of cells in the urinary bladder. The urinary bladder is a muscular organ which stores urine before it is discharged out of the body. This organ is located in the pelvic region of the body. The abnormal multiplication of cells gives rise to a number of malignant growths in the bladder. The most common form of bladder cancer is called the transitional cell carcinoma which affects the cells lining the bladder. It is also referred to as the urothelial cell carcinoma.

          <h2>Causes & Risk Factors</h2>
          <p>The exact causes of bladder cancer are unknown; however, there are a number of factors which are responsible for this condition. There are a number of potential carcinogens which have been identified which are known to cause bladder cancer. The most important risk factors associated with this condition are:</p>
          <br>
              1. Smoking is one of the major risk factors which is responsible for causing bladder cancer.<br>
2. Exposure hazards at work: Certain chemicals are known to be carcinogenic and these can cause cancers. It is important to make sure that one is well protected from such exposure. <br>
3. Diet is also an important factor in determining cancer. It is believed that people who consume more fried meat and red meat are more prone to suffer from bladder cancer than those who donâ€™t.<br>
<br>
<p>The other factors that count are age, sex, race and even history of bladder cancer. Chronic bladder inflammation and birth defects may also cause bladder cancer.</p>

          <h2>Symptoms & Signs</h2>
          <p>The most common symptoms of bladder cancer include: <br>
          1. Burning micturation without any signs of urinary tract infection.<br>
2. Hematuria or blood in the urine.<br>
3. Changes in bladder habits like frequent urination or urination without producing much urine.<br>
<br>
<p>However, these symptoms are non-specific in nature and may not necessarily cause blood cancer. In older people, presence of blood in the urine can be considered as a likelihood of bladder cancer until it is proven otherwise. Most often these symptoms are seen in the advanced stages of the condition and cure in the advanced stage is difficult.</p>

1. Burning sensation at the back<br>
2. The pain disturbs the sleep<br>
3. Difficulty to sit in same position for long time.<br>
4. Dull ache or pressure which may become severe due to movement or coughing.<br>
5. Pain appears when standing from a seated position.<br>
6. Tingling sensation and numbness in the back of the legs extending till the feet<br>

              <h2>Treatment</h2>
              <p>
                 The treatment for Bladder cancer includes radiation therapy, chemotherapy and surgery. While surgery and radiation therapy aim at getting rid of the cancerous cells alone the chemotherapy is a more systemic treatment and can kill cancer cells in any part of the body.
