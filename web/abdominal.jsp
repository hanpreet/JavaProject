          <h2>Introduction</h2>
   Abdominal malignancy can be referred to as a cancerous tumor forming either in stomach, pancreas, duodenum or gall bladder. The abdomen is mainly comprised of these organs and any deformity in any of these organs can be termed as abdominal malignancy. The word malignancy indicates that the deformity caused in any these organs is of a serious nature and is not benign. The tumor often malignant in nature can be life threatening and may not show any visible symptom in the initial stage. Their presence in the initial stages may be indicated by mild pain in the abdomen which is often ignored by most people. Most people presume the initial pain to be a gastro intestinal trouble and they often rely on analgesic to subside the pain. The case becomes too complicated when the tumor enlarges and reaches a stage where its cure becomes very difficult. In certain circumstances an inflammation may take place.

          <h2>Causes & Risk Factors</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>One of the most prominent causes of tumor is abnormal growth of cells inside the body. The cell division (also known as mitosis and meiosis) undergoes severe changes due to the abnormality in the cell structure. The whole process of cell division inside the body is affected during the abnormal growth of cells.</li>
              <li>There is no single reason that can be attributed to this abnormal growth of cell yet the most common causes are unhealthy diet, nicotine consumption, unhealthy lifestyle, lack of nutrition etc.</li>
              <li>Genetic factors most often do not play any role in cases of abdominal malignancy and have been found to have no effect on any individual. Yet exceptions do persist and few cases have been reported where an individual seemed to have inherited the disease from either of the parents.</li>
              <li>The level of risk associated with the disease is quite high especially when abdominal malignancy is not diagnosed in the initial stages. The patient feels acute pain only when the tumor enlarges and by that time the cancerous cells reach such an advanced stage that they often get out of control until otherwise excellent treatment is meted put to the patients. Even the treatment of abdominal malignancy is quite expensive and on prolonged basis involving many stages of treatment.</li>

          <h2>Symptoms & Signs</h2>
          <p>Although the most initial symptom in some circumstances is often a slight inflammation but since in case of abdominal malignancy it is obscure, patients often do not realize them. A pain is felt and the degree of pain often varies on the growth of the tumor.  Most often cancerous cells do not reveal many symptoms or give any indication to the patients and this is the prime reason why this disease is considered to be so fatal. The pain is directly proportional to the size of the tumor and the degree of its maturity. Symptoms of cancerous cells are very rare and pain acts like a marker to the advancement of the disease. Pain can be considered to be more or less the most dominant feature of this disease.</p>

              <h2>Treatment</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li>Once the tumor is detected, emergency treatment is mandatory for survival. It may be through many sessions of chemotherapy provided the tumor is detected at an early stage.</li>
                  <li>However in cases where tumor has reached a stage which is difficult to be cured by chemotherapy alone, surgical incision is the only solution. The pain causing organ containing the tumor has to be removed from the body not only to restore pain free life to the patients but also ensure that other associated organs are at less risk of getting damaged or affected.</li>
<li>Patients who are acquiescent to surgery first need to be on medication to control their immense pain. After successful surgical incision and removal of the affected organ the patients cam lead a normal life.</li>
