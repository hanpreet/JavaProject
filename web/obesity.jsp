          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p align="justify">
          Obesity is a chronic disease resulting from accumulation of excess fat in the body. A person is considered obese when his or her weight is 20% or more than normal weight proportional to his height.
<br><br>
The most common measure of obesity is the body mass index or BMI. A person is considered overweight if his or her BMI is between 25 and 29.9; a person is considered obese if his or her BMI is over 30.
The term "Morbid obesity" determines a person who is either 50%-100% over normal weight, more than 100 pounds over normal weight, has a BMI of 40 or higher, or is sufficiently overweight to severely interfere with health or normal function.
<br><br>
India is following a trend of other developing countries that are steadily becoming more obese. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in India in the 21st century, with morbid obesity affecting 5% of the country's population.
<br><br>
According to the Lancet journal, the obesity epidemic is spreading to low-income and middle-income countries as a result of new dietary habits and sedentary lifestyle. Presently one in six women and one in five men in India are obese. There has been an increase in overweight or obese citizens by 20% between 1998 and 2005.
<br><br>
Present status of obesity in India is as below,
Overweight: Females- 47.5% males- 32%
Obese: female- 14% males- 3%
Abdominal adiposity: female- 35 male- 49%
<br><br>
According to The World health statistics 2012 report of WHO, one in six adults is obese. Obesity levels are highest in the WHO Region of the Americas (26%) and the lowest in the WHO South-East Asia Region (3%). All over the world, women are more likely to be obese than men, and hence at greater risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers </div>

          <h2>Causes & Risk Factors</h2>
          <p align="justify">
