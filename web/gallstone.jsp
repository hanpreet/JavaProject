          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p align="justify">
Gallstones are solid particles that form from bile in the gallbladder. The gallbladder is part of the biliary system, which includes the liver and the pancreas.

<br>Synonyms:<br>Cholelithiasis

<b>Types</b> - There are two types of gallstones:<br>
1) cholesterol stones and<br>
2) pigment stones. <br>
Patients with <b>cholesterol stones</b> are more common in the United States, making up approximately 80% of all gallstones. They form when there is too much cholesterol in the bile.<b> Pigment stones</b> form when there is excess bilirubin in the bile.

          <h2>Causes & Risk Factors</h2>
          <p align="justify">
              Gallstones are the most common cause of gallbladder disease.<br><br>

Pigment stones form when bilirubin is high, in people with liver disease or blood disease. Additionally, poor muscle tone may keep the gallbladder from emptying completely. 
The presence of residual bile may promote the formation of gallstones.<br><br>

Cholesterol gallstones form when the amount of cholesterol in the bile is high. Risk factors for cholesterol gallstones: Include female gender, being overweight, weight loss following crash or starvation diet, medications such as birth control pills or cholesterol-lowering drugs.
<br><br>
As the stones mix with liquid bile, they can block the outflow of bile from the gallbladder. They can also block the outflow of digestive enzymes from the pancreas. If the blockage persists, these organs can become inflamed. Inflammation of the gallbladder is called cholecystitis. Inflammation of the pancreas is called pancreatitis. It is reasonable to assume that a diet with large amounts of cholesterol and other fats increases the risk of gallstones. When the gallbladder or gallbladder ducts become inflamed or infected as the result of stones, the pancreas frequently becomes inflamed too. This inflammation can cause destruction of the pancreas and severe abdominal pain. 
Untreated gallstone disease can become life-threatening, particularly if the gallbladder becomes infected or if the pancreas becomes severely inflamed.

          <h2>Symptoms & Signs</h2>
          <p align="justify">
              1. Silent gallstones - 60%-80% gallstones detected on sonography(Ultrasound) in patients without any symptoms. They remain unaware and usually require no treatment.<br>
             2. Symptomatic gallstones - Symptoms occur as complications develop. <b>Biliary colic</b> - Most common symptom is pain in the right upper part of the abdomen. Pain may occur every few days, weeks, months or years. Usually, pain starts within 30 minutes after a fatty meal. It may spread towards the right shoulder or spine. Pain occurs frequently at night and may awaken the person from sleep. Relief of pain could be spontaneous. People usually prefer to lay still and wait for the attack to subside. 
Other common symptoms - nausea and vomiting, fever, indigestion, belching, bloating, intolerance for fatty or greasy foods, and jaundice Emergency consultation - If abdominal pain cannot be controlled with over-the-counter pain medication, accompanying vomiting or fever, chills, sweating, backache, jaundice.

              <h2>Treatment</h2>
              <p align="justify">About Surgery: The usual treatment for symptomatic or complicated gallstones is surgical removal of the gallbladder. This is called cholecystectomy.  Surgical removal of gallbladder helps prevent future episodes of abdominal pain and more dangerous complications such as inflammation of the pancreas and infection of the gallbladder and liver.<br><br>

How can one function without a gallbladder? - Fortunately, you can live without your gallbladder. Living without a gallbladder does not require a change in diet. When the gallbladder is gone, bile flows directly from the liver into the small intestine. Because there is nowhere to store bile, sometimes bile flows into the intestine when it is not needed. This does not cause a problem for most people, but causes mild diarrhea in about 1% of patients.
<br><br>
<b>Laparoscopic removal- Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy:</b> Most gallbladders are removed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The gallbladder is removed through small incisions measuring 0.5 – 1 cm. The tube-like instruments have a camera and surgical instruments attached, which are used to take out the gallbladder with the stones inside it. This procedure causes less pain than open surgery. It is less likely to cause complications, and has a faster recovery time. This is preferred surgery if it is appropriate for the patient. The procedure is performed in an operating room with the patient under general anesthesia. It usually takes 20 minutes to one hour. A general surgeon performs the operation. In some cases where the gall bladder is stuck to liver or intestines, a laparoscopic procedure is started and then changed to an open abdominal procedure.
        <br><br>
        <b>Conventional / Open removal:</b> The gallbladder is sometimes removed through a 3 to 6 inch incision in the right upper abdomen. The open procedure usually is used only when laparoscopic surgery is not feasible for a specific person. Common reasons for doing an open procedure are infection in the biliary tract and scars from previous surgeries. This procedure is performed in the operating room, with the patient under general anesthesia. It usually takes 45-90 minutes. A general surgeon performs the operation.
        <br><br>
        <b>Follow-up</b> – Usually, follow-up are required to check the operation sites. No long term follow-up or care is required.
        <br><br>
        <b>Prevention</b> - A low-fat, low-cholesterol diet can prevent symptoms of gallstones but cannot prevent formation of stones. It is not known why some people form stones and others do not.
<br><br>
<b>General Advice</b> - If gallstones block one of the biliary ducts, the result is inflammation and swelling of the organs "upstream" of the blocked duct. This complication alone can cause symptoms and warrants treatment, possibly surgery. If untreated, it can lead to more serious conditions such as infection and damage to the gallbladder, liver, and pancreas. If these organs sustain enough damage, they can no longer carry out their normal functions. This is a life-threatening complication.
<br><br>
<b>Post-operative advice:</b> Following laparoscopic gallbladder surgery, one may leave the hospital 12-48 hours after surgery and return to full activities within three weeks. If open surgery was required to remove the gallbladder, recovery takes a little longer. The person may leave the hospital within three to seven days and could resume normal activity after a six week recovery period. If a person chooses not to have their gallbladder removed, it is likely you will have recurring abdominal pain and possibly complications.</p>
